// RouteRequest asks a RouteSelector to pick one target for a request routed

// scores slower than a target that succeeds at once.

// RouteSelector steers load balancing for virtual models using the

// rate-limit capacity, failover chains, and retries remain core's
// responsibility.
//
// Select must be fast and must not block: it runs on the request path before
// the upstream call. Implementations must be safe for concurrent use. A
// (_, false) answer — and any answer naming a model outside Candidates —
// falls back to weighted round robin, so selectors fail open by declining.
//
// OnAttemptStart and OnAttemptEnd observe the upstream client lifecycle,
// once per upstream call (transport-level retries within a call are
// aggregated — see RouteOutcome). For streaming requests OnAttemptEnd fires
// when the stream is established, not when it closes.
