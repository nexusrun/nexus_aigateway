// Package sqlx lets one store implementation serve both SQL backends.
//
// SQLite and PostgreSQL stores in this repository were historically written
// twice. Comparing the two halves, the differences were never about business
// logic — they were the driver handle type, the placeholder syntax, the
// no-rows sentinel, the Exec result shape, and a handful of DDL type names.
// This package absorbs exactly those five things and nothing else.
//
// Deliberately NOT abstracted:
//
//   - Value binding and scanning. Both drivers already agree: a Go bool binds
//     to SQLite INTEGER and PostgreSQL BOOLEAN, an INTEGER scans into *bool,
//     and TEXT/JSON/JSONB all scan into *[]byte. Stores bind and scan plain Go
//     types on both backends.
//   - Genuinely dialect-specific migrations. Rewriting a table is a different
//     operation in each engine; those stay behind a Dialect() check rather
//     than pretending to be portable.
//   - MongoDB. Document semantics are not a SQL dialect and stay hand-written.
