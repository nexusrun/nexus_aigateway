// authVerifyMethodNone is reported when the request carried no credential this

	// Method is "api_key" for a managed key stored in the database,
	// "master_key" for the bootstrap key, an extension-specific value for

	// when Valid is false.

	// Absent for every other method.

// AuthVerify handles GET /v1/auth/verify.
//
// The route exists so a service in front of the gateway can ask whether an API
// key is usable without holding a copy of the key list. It is disabled by
// default and enabled with server.auth_verify_enabled (AUTH_VERIFY_ENABLED);
// it lives outside /admin so it stays reachable when the admin API is off.
//
// The endpoint adds no credential check of its own: the request passes the
// same authentication middleware as every model route, so an invalid, expired,
// or unknown key is rejected there with 401 and never reaches this handler. A
// 200 therefore means the credential authenticates, and the body reports which
// mechanism accepted it — "api_key" is the managed-key case, the one backed by
// a database row. On a gateway with no authentication configured every request
// is accepted, so the answer is valid=false with method "none": there is no
// key to confirm.
//
// @Summary      Verify an API key
// @Description  Reports whether the presented credential authenticates against this gateway. Returns 401 when it does not. A gateway with no authentication configured has no credential to confirm and answers 200 with valid=false and method=none. Disabled unless AUTH_VERIFY_ENABLED is set.
