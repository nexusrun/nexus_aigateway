// Subsystem teardown.
//
// The gateway has two teardown paths, and they deliberately run different
// orders:
//
//   - Startup failure unwinds construction in strict reverse. Nothing ever
//     served traffic, so reverse construction is always safe.
//   - Runtime shutdown quiesces before it flushes, which is not the reverse of
//     construction: providers close first so the model refresh loop stops,
//     while the shared storage connection closes last, after every producer
//     has flushed into it.
//
// Neither order derives from the other, so the runtime order stays spelled out
// by hand in shutdownOrder. What this file removes is the drift risk of
// maintaining two independent lists: every subsystem registers exactly once
// during construction, and TestShutdownOrderCoversEveryRegisteredSubsystem
// fails when the hand-written order stops covering the registry.

// closerOwner names the teardown path that releases a registered subsystem at
// runtime. Startup failure releases every registered subsystem regardless of
// owner.
